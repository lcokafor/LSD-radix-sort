# LSD-radix-sort
An assignment from the class INF2440 - Effective Parallel Programming taken Spring 2018 at the University of Oslo, which involved coding a parallelised implementation of the Least Significant Digit radix sort and achieving speedup as compared to the sequential implementation.

Please read 'Oblig 4 report' for instructions on how to run code.

Oblig4Precode.java and SekvensiellRadix.java are not written by me, but are necessary for Oblig4.java to run properly. They were provided with assignment.
